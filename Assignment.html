    <p>My name is Yuki Fumingo from Japan. I have 6 people in my family .  Travelling to other countries
        each year has become our family custom since I was born .we start to travel overseas when the year 
        I was born .we went to <b>AMERICA, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE and ENGLAND, CHINA, KOREA, and TAIWAN</b>.My name especially 
        loves travelling.She is always talking about travelling when the time comes close to a vacation.I heard 
        from my mom ,my dad use to not like but my mom took him every where .He began to like travelling since then.

    </p>

    <div><p>Now i have grown up .Our family lives separetely.My parents and grandmother are living in JAPAN where I was born.
        I have two older brother who are living in CHINA for studies and i am living in USA also for studies .But of course 
        we will go travel this year too.We probably go to GERMANY in this summer vacation where the place my mom wants to go.
        </p>
    <p> As for me wherever I am travelling with my family .It is always much fun and meaningful .Since we have less time together.
